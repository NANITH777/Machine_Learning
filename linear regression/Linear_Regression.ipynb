    "`Linear regression` is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (the variable to be predicted) and one or more independent variables (predictor variables). It assumes that this relationship is linear, meaning that the dependent variable can be estimated as a linear combination of the independent variables, plus a random error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main utility of linear regression lies in its ability to predict or explain the value of a target variable (dependent variable) based on explanatory variables (independent variables). It is widely used in many fields, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Economics**: To model relationships between economic variables such as income, consumption, investment, etc.\n",
    "2. **Data science**: In predictive analytics to forecast future behaviors, estimate trends, etc.\n",
    "3. **Medical research**: To study the relationship between risk factors and diseases.\n",
    "4. **Engineering**: To model the relationship between design factors and product performance.\n",
    "5. **Finance**: To model investment returns based on various factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is used when the data appear to have a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, and when one wants to predict or understand this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that linear regression has its limitations, especially when the relationship between variables is not linear or when data exhibit issues such as multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, etc. In such cases, more advanced statistical modeling techniques may be necessary."
