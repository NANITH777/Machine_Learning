    "`Logistic regression` is a supervised learning technique used for binary classification. Contrary to its name, logistic regression is actually a `classification algorithm` rather than a regression one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `goal` of logistic regression is to predict the probability that a given example belongs to a particular class. This probability is then transformed into a binary class value (0 or 1) using a thresholding function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression uses a logistic (or sigmoid) function to model the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The logistic function ranges from 0 to 1 and is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where \\( z \\) is a linear combination of the independent variables and their corresponding coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is commonly used in the following cases:\n",
    "- Binary classification: Predicting whether an example belongs to one of two classes (e.g., yes/no, true/false).\n",
    "- Probability modeling: Estimating the probability that an example belongs to a particular class.\n",
    "- Risk analysis: Evaluating factors contributing to an event (e.g., predicting the likelihood of developing a disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "The uniqueness of logistic regression compared to other machine learning models lies in its ability to provide class probabilities rather than direct class predictions. Additionally, logistic regression is relatively simple to interpret and implement, making it a popular choice for many classification problems. It is also less prone to overfitting compared to some more complex models. However, it may not perform well with nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables."
